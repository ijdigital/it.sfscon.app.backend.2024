				<title>What the AI revolution means for Open Source, Open Tech and Open Societies</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the last year we saw the rise of AI systems like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Dall-E and others. Large Language Models like GPT are enabling a lot of new innovative features and products which will revolutionise the world.&lt;br /&gt;
But this large autoregressive language models come with a lot of challenges that can have negative effects on the Open Source and Open Tech community. For example it’s unclear if in the future everyone will have access to the same ML models and training data. Can students, startups and open source people build innovative new products using AI in the same way the open source communities build Open Code and Open Tech. How can we make sure that the AI system are not discriminating underrepresented minorities? What is the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of this new big AI systems?&lt;br /&gt;
This talk will discuss the current fascinating trends in AI, the challenges and some possible solution. It will also cover the current Open Source AI features in Nextcloud and our Ethical AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The First Year of Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle: a successful “code first” approach</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The most notable impact of using SW in the automotive domain is the decrease in fatalities as ADAS functions are more widely employed. On the other hand, SW complexity has seen an almost exponential growth reaching about 100 million lines of code.&lt;br /&gt;
Hardly any organization can tackle this challenge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Working Group ’s mission is to foster collaboration across industries to create an open technology platform for the software defined vehicle of the future. The working group community driven by its 40 member organization has chosen a “code first” approach to facilitate more agile and faster time-to-market software development.&lt;br /&gt;
After its formation about a year ago, the SDV WG has onboarded about 20 open source projects and is working on integrating several projects together to create “blueprints”. The frameworks emerging from these initial blueprints show the potential and benefits of utilizing different projects as components to build broader solutions to address more complex problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contribution introduces the SDV WG and Community, as well as its projects and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pyccel: write Python code, get Fortran speed</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine writing a pure Python library which can achieve the performance of Fortran or C/C++.&lt;br /&gt;
To this end we have developed Pyccel, which translates Python code to either Fortran or C, and makes the generated code callable from Python. The generated Fortran or C code is not only fast, but also human-readable; hence it can easily be profiled and optimized for the target machine.&lt;br /&gt;
Pyccel has a focus on high-performance computing applications, where the efficient usage of the available hardware resources is fundamental.&lt;br /&gt;
To this end it provides type annotations, function decorators, and OpenMP pragmas.&lt;br /&gt;
Pyccel is easy to use, is almost completely written in Python, and compares favourably against other Python accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flaky tests – how to deal with them</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Every QA/QE professional has encountered a flaky test at least once in their career. It may be a small, harmless bug that can be fixed in an instant, or it may take months to identify and fix it. This can be very costly and take a toll on your reputation and budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t you want to know why flaky tests exist, how to identify them at an earlier stage, or even avoid them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the investigation and we will figure it out together with you to find out the origins and roots of common flaky tests; to explore real cases and their solutions; to learn good practices.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Ease of use and high performance in the open-source Python ecosystem</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Psydac is an open source library for isogeometric analysis (IGA), that is, a finite element method which uses the same basis functions of a CAD model (B-splines and NURBS).&lt;br /&gt;
It has been developed at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, with the goal of exploring advanced numerical methods for electromagnetism, magneto-hydro-dynamics, and plasma kinetics. It is completely written in Python, uses only open-source libraries, and can run large parallel simulations on high-performance computing facilities. It employs a domain specific language, automatic code generation, a transpiler, MPI communication, OpenMP multithreading, and parallel I/O. In this talk we explore the library architecture and its overall design philosophy, which can be applied to other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The incredible machine: when automation backfires</title>

				<abstract>The hidden costs of automation</abstract>
				<subtitle>The hidden costs of automation</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to apply CI/CD principles and run tests for every change?&lt;br /&gt;
But it is too complex to set up the test environment, and launch the tests with all the updated parameters, solution? Automation!&lt;br /&gt;
Release your software implies a countless number of complicated steps, what solution? Automation!&lt;br /&gt;
So automation sometimes seems to be the solution, you automate some complex procedure and call the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But automation of a process sometimes can only hide the real problem and only delay the moment when you have to address the technical debt, and sometimes the automation can even also act as an amplifier of the technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the experience matured on the field, this talk will be shown the hidden traps of automation, the drawbacks, and the lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share our experience with writing clients for the RabbitMQ stream queues.&lt;br /&gt;
The RabbitMQ stream queues have been designed with performance as a major goal. So the clients have to be performant.&lt;br /&gt;
We will see how we increased the throughput and/or reduced the latency.&lt;br /&gt;
.NET and Go clients will be taken as examples. We will go through some real production code.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>squash the flakes!</title>

				<abstract>how to minimize the impact of flaky tests</abstract>
				<subtitle>how to minimize the impact of flaky tests</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Flakes aka tests that don’t behave deterministically, i.e. they fail sometimes and pass sometimes, are an ever recurring problem in software development. This is especially the sad reality when running e2e tests where a lot of components are involved. There are various reasons why a test can be flaky, however the impact can be as fatal as CI being loaded beyond capacity causing overly long feedback cycles or even users losing trust in CI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to remove flakes as fast as possible to minimize the number of retests required. This leads to shorter time to merge, reduces CI user frustration, improves trust in CI, while at the same time it decreases the overall load for the CI system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by generating a report of tests that have failed at least once inside a merged PR, meaning that in the end all tests have succeeded, thus flaky tests have been run inside CI. We then look at the report to separate flakes from real issues and forward the flakes to dev teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result retest numbers have gone down significantly over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attending the session the user will have an idea of what our flake process is, how we exercise it and what the actual outcomes are.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A comparison of Open Source FaaS technologies</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As the demand for serverless computing continues to grow, the availability and choice of open source Function as a Service (FaaS) technologies are expanding rapidly. In this talk, we will present our experience in using some of the most popular open source FaaS platforms, compare them and discussing their features and characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session will begin with an introduction to serverless computing and the key concepts behind FaaS. Throughout the talk, we will analyze various aspects such as ease of deployment, architecture, specific features, etc. We will examine real-world use cases and share insights on the strengths and limitations of each platform, allowing attendees to make informed decisions when choosing the right FaaS technology for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this session, attendees will have a better understanding of the open source FaaS landscape from our experience in production usage.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>A few ideas on architecting for the journey, not for the destination</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Microservices is a trend, and for a reason: it’s an architecture style that enables many desirable qualities on the systems that adopt it. By being distributed, it allows using the right technology stack for each capability, at the same time it eases the evolution of each fine-grained part of the system. But it comes with a price and offers significant risks, in particular related to larger portions of the architecture, and also the management of the entire infrastructure. Those costs and risks are the biggest challenges for a new system, when it adopts microservices from the start. But, on the other hand, starting with a monolith might require a big effort to migrate towards microservices in the future. Is that a check-mate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely not! Don’t let microservices kill you! In this talk, we’re going to see some ideas about architecting the system focusing on the journey. After all, we spend most of the time maintaining and evolving the system, than actually leaving it running “stably”. Also, by seeing how to start something new, we’re actually going to discuss the best architecture practices for any given time of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>A tour on aggressive use of git branching with automation for distributed cooperation</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Contributing to large open source projects is not always a fast or smooth sailing process, and is often stalled simply due to the necessary human factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributions are rarely accepted quickly or as-is, and it&amp;#8217;s not uncommon to rework each submission extensively by splitting the proposed change into separated fixes and features, into smaller incremental changes where each is tested independently or sometimes perform complete rewrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the vetting of each submission can require weeks, contributors often feel blocked by the need to wait for their own or peer&amp;#8217;s changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope in these scenarios, we present a few git branching and automation strategies that allow efficient wait-free development of interconnected changes, even across community members, in a truly distributed fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kubernetes for IoT</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>How kubernetes can help you quickly and automatically test and deploy new services</abstract>
				<subtitle>How kubernetes can help you quickly and automatically test and deploy new services</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;While Kubernetes is primarily associated with managing cloud-native applications and microservices, it can also play a role in IoT deployments. Here are a few reasons why Kubernetes is relevant in the context of IoT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Scalability: IoT systems often involve a large number of devices generating massive amounts of data. Kubernetes provides automatic scaling capabilities, allowing IoT applications to scale horizontally by adding or removing instances based on demand. This helps manage the increasing workload efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Resilience and High Availability: IoT applications require high availability to ensure uninterrupted operations. Kubernetes offers features like load balancing, fault tolerance, and self-healing capabilities. It can automatically restart failed containers or replace them with healthy instances, ensuring that IoT services remain available and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Resource Optimization: IoT deployments typically involve a mix of hardware devices with varying capabilities. Kubernetes can optimize resource utilization by efficiently distributing workloads across devices. It allows you to define resource constraints and priorities, ensuring that devices with higher capabilities handle more demanding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Service Discovery and Load Balancing: In an IoT ecosystem, devices and services need to discover and communicate with each other. Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery mechanisms, such as DNS-based service discovery and load balancing, allowing devices to locate and interact with services dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Security and Updates: Security is a crucial aspect of IoT systems, and Kubernetes helps in managing security at scale. It provides features like role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, and secret management to enforce security measures across IoT deployments. Additionally, Kubernetes facilitates rolling updates, allowing for seamless updates and patches without downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 Flexibility and Portability: Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, enabling IoT applications to be deployed consistently across different environments, whether it&amp;#8217;s on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. This flexibility allows organizations to migrate or distribute their IoT workloads as needed, making it easier to adopt hybrid or multi-cloud strategies&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pitfalls and Mistakes When Dealing With Non-Functional Requirements</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-functional requirements are essential to define the software architecture, and if they are not identified and handled correctly, the impact can be huge. This talk will present some common mistakes when handling non-functional requirements. It starts talking about the ones defined at the beginning of the project with a false certainty, which can become an even worst problem if they are never revised. Then, we will pass through the client that always wants the complete package and talk about the ones that are only remembered when some user complains. Of course, the talk does not forget about those that try to treat those very different non-functional requirements in exactly the same way. In the end, it will be presented some practices that can be used to avoid these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

He considers the principles of Agile Software Development the core guidance of his research since they share the goal to improve software quality, optimize development time, and increase software adaptability. Test-driven development (TDD) was the core of several works that focused on test code refactoring, application of TDD for specific kinds of software, and teaching and evaluating the technique. Also, in the scope of programming techniques, the usage of metadata and code annotations were the focus of several works that aimed to study them as an alternative to make the software more adaptable and improve the code quality.&quot;">Eduardo Guerra</person>

				<abstract>Discover the low-code framework that accelerate app development</abstract>
				<subtitle>Discover the low-code framework that accelerate app development</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays application implementation requires a lot of different competencies that make it impossible for a single person to build an entire application. This led to the need for a big multi-competencies team and increasing in communication issues during the project. But what if we could implement an application without the need of implementing a backend? CrudIt does exactly that. CrudiIt is an open-source framework that enables a small team or a single front-end developer to create small SaaS applications without any knowledge of backend, cloud and sysadmin needs.&lt;br /&gt;
During the event, we will see how to implement a simple SaaS service using Crudit and how to use the framework to accelerate application development.&lt;br /&gt;
Moreover, we will discuss how to host a CrudIt application without any sysadmin competencies in the cloud, using free services.&lt;br /&gt;
This talk will unveil how, thanks to this powerful low-code framework, it is possible to save data without writing a line of code, even if you are working in complex, multitenant scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;
The talk will explain also how the framework is born, how it works internally and promote the opensource philosophy that brings to this library.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>From the definition of a proof of concept study to the development and testing of the required technical infrastructure</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Digital therapies are evidence-based therapeutic interventions that use software to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease.&lt;br /&gt;
Not only they require carefully planned clinical studies, but they require also a suitable technical infrastructure not to lose or compromise relevant information. Consequently, careful software testing and monitoring is necessary to ensure that the technical infrastructure is working correctly during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will describe the entire process used for the analysis of the effectiveness of Nearine, a digital therapy for the management of depressive symptoms based on interoceptive stimulation through vibrations applied on the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;
We will start with the description of the remote proof of concept study used for the assessment of the effectiveness and potential adverse effects. After that, the technical infrastructure necessary for the study will be outlined.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally we will show how the usage of CatchSolve for software testing has decreased the risk of potential loss of information during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is the result of a joint collaboration between CatchSolve, software testing startup based in NOI Techpark, and Nearine, a new digital health and neurotechnology startup based in Bolzano.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Wearable hackers meet e-health experts to make a first class open source Android app</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Gadgetbridge, a free and open source project, has existed since 2015 to allow wearable device customers to use their hardware without being tied to the online services of the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small but very focused and capable technical community working on the basic functionalities such as retrieving the various data from the wearables (detected activities, sleep, pulse per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation, &amp;#8230;) lacks the expertise on specialised algorithms that could help to perform advanced analysis/diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to explore a potential collaboration between our communities: Gadgetbridge provides local-only support for an extensive list of wearable devices and a community of engineers and privacy minded users, Data4SmartHealth might contribute advanced algorithms and AI on edge devices.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Machine learning driven simulation of protein folding atomistic trajectories</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The folding of proteins is an important biological process that determines the structure, role and functionality of proteins. It is often studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in order to obtain the folding trajectory of all the atoms in the system.&lt;br /&gt;
To date, pure MD simulations require huge computational resources and are still unable to access the timescales of folding processes that have biological relevance.&lt;br /&gt;
In my work, I am exploiting machine learning techniques and one recent AI milestone, Deepmind&amp;#8217;s Alphafold, in order to create an advanced algorithm able to explore the folding trajectories within short computational times. It becomes possible to extract atomistic conformations from the folding pathways, and identify folding intermediates and long-lived states.&lt;br /&gt;
This method can be used to facilitate the identification of biologically relevant protein conformations, later to be used for pharmacological targeting or biophysical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

				<language/>
				<abstract>Artificial Intelligence to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders</abstract>
				<subtitle>Artificial Intelligence to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which is largely responsible for dementia in around 6% of the population aged 65 and above. The availability of human brain data generated by imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, have resulted in a growing interest in data-driven approaches for the diagnosis of neurological disorders and for the identification of new biomarkers. The knowledge discovery process typically involves complex data workflows that combine pre-processing techniques, statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, post-processing and visualisation techniques. This talk presents specific research efforts in this direction, promising results, open issues and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Management of large genomic data with free software</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The suite of free software tools created within the OpenCB (Open Computational Biology &amp;#8211; https://github.com/opencb) initiative makes possible to efficiently manage large genomic databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools are not widely used, since there is quite a steep learning curve for their adoption, thanks to the complexity of the software stack, but they may be really cost-effective for hospitals, research institutions etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the talk is showing the potential of the OpenCB suite, the information to start using it and the advantages for the end users. BioDec is currently deploying a large OpenCGA installation for the Genetic Unit of one of the main Italian Hospitals, where data in the order of the hundreds of TBs will be managed and analyzed by bioinformaticians.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Self-hosted, Open Source Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>What are the most promising projects and how good are they?</abstract>
				<subtitle>What are the most promising projects and how good are they?</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years different groups have used the transformer architecture (a deep learning model) to train neural networks using large quantities of text. With the increase in compute power these models have grown to billions or even hundred of billions of parameters. As the model size grew, noteworthy abilities emerged. Such as the ability to generate text showing surprising reasoning skills to the point that the leading models can now successfully take college-level exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently some of the best and most famous models are proprietary and released to the public as a service. However a large Open Source community has emerged that tries to train and fine tune free models that can be used self-hosted. This is a challenging task due to problems with potential copyright issues with the training text, the large computational cost of the training itself and the supervised fine tuning step to adapt the model to its final use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give an overview on what the most promising projects in this space are and how they compare to the proprietary state-of-the-art models of the large players.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Artificial Intelligence within Nextcloud</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At Nextcloud we believe that in order to achieve digital sovereignty we always need to stretch the boundaries. If new technologies and new ways of working come up, we work hard to enable our users to enjoy the same functionality without giving up control over their data and computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months we saw a lot of innovation in the area of artificial intelligence which might change our way of working to a large extend. At Nextcloud we are happy that we can already provide the first features in this areas to our users. Unfortunately not all features work completely on-premise as of today. That&amp;#8217;s why we introduced a &amp;#8220;Ethical AI Rating&amp;#8221; which provides transparency to the user and let them decide what to use today, while we are working hard to base more and more of this features on Free Software and on-premise solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will present Nextcloud&amp;#8217;s AI-features, the Ethical AI Rating and how we try to approach innovations in a fast moving IT world, in order to bring similar functionality to the Free Software community.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Optimizing Software Performance with Inductive Logic Programming: A Novel Approach</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Concurrent execution of tasks can significantly improve its performance and efficiency. However, identifying which tasks can be executed concurrently and which tasks need to be executed sequentially can be a challenging task. In this talk, I propose using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to create a dynamic dependency graph for a given program. The graph can be used to identify which tasks can be executed concurrently and which tasks need to be executed sequentially. I demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to a sample program and comparing its performance with a version that does not utilize concurrent execution. This talk presents a novel approach to creating a dynamic dependency graph for programs and highlights the potential benefits of using ILP for optimizing the performance of complex software systems.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>A Retrieval-based Approach for Open Vocabulary Image Classification</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The advancement in language and vision models (LLM) has seen remarkable progress in recent years. However, the training of these large-scale models poses challenges in terms of time and computational resources, particularly with regards to deep learning models that require powerful GPUs. This has created a significant gap between Big Tech companies, who possess substantial resources to train LLM models, and academia, which often lacks the necessary means to contribute significantly in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, we propose an innovative open vocabulary framework called CaSED (Category Search from External Databases). Unlike traditional LLM models, CaSED does not rely on extensive training. Instead, it leverages retrieval techniques from an image-text knowledge base to classify or tag images automatically. By utilizing existing knowledge bases rather than requiring extensive training, CaSED eliminates the need for large computational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will show the potential of low-budget approaches in the context of Language and Vision.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Deploying the PeARS search engine in regional communities</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that Web search engines require immense resources to operate, making it impossible for small communities to build alternatives to the dominant players. The PeARS project (https://pearsproject.org/) aims at changing the status quo by providing open-source search tools that can be used by anyone, anywhere. To achieve this, our team designs algorithms that run on entry-level hardware, using both traditional and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on a specific use case for PeARS, showing how the framework can easily be deployed to provide regional search solutions: for instance for local governments, small business communities, or minority speaker groups. We will see how the system can be trained and populated on a home computer in a few clicks and how it can be tailored to the specific community it is addressed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has received funding from the European Union under the Next Generation Internet programme.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Image Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

				<abstract>How computers imagine our world</abstract>
				<subtitle>How computers imagine our world</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent machine learning developments saw a breakthrough in generating images. So-called Diffusion Models can create photo-realistic images from noise. With the help of an input text (prompt) we can guide the generation and produce matching images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology opened new doors for creating digital art, modifying existing images, and creating stunning visual experiences. In the talk, we will find out how these algorithms work, introduce Stable Diffusion (a concrete implementation), and find out what its use cases are. We will see how text can be used to generate matching outputs but also take a look at more experimental features such as creating images from edges, outlines, or depth maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will mainly focus on the open source text-to-image model Stable Diffusion, which has set new standards in image generation. With it also comes an active community that keeps it open source and accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Copyleft, Software, Freedom, &amp; You: Better Understanding Through History</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Copyleft licensing has been the primary strategy of the FOSS community to guarantee users&amp;#8217; rights to copy, share, modify, redistribute reinstall modified versions of their software. In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we&amp;#8217;d sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality check that we&amp;#8217;ve received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue. Nevertheless, those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work how it does and discuss ideas and suggestions of future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

				<abstract>an overview about reproducible builds, the past, the presence and the future</abstract>
				<subtitle>an overview about reproducible builds, the past, the presence and the future</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk Holger Levsen will give an overview about reproducible builds, the past, the presence and the future. How it started with a small BoF at DebConf13 (and before), how it grew from being a Debian effort to something many projects work on together, until in 2021 it was mentioned in an executive order of the president of the United States. And of course the talk will not end there but rather outline where we are today and where we still need to be going, until we&amp;#8217;ll all be running 100% reproducible software, verified by many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while Holger&amp;#8217;s day to day work and this talk will have a Debian focus, reproducible builds in other project will be featured and not be left behind as Holger has been involved in Reproducible Builds since 2014 and has been working on reproducing Arch Linux, coreboot, Fedora, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenWrt and others. Other important software projects will also be covered and last not least Holger will also explain why you&amp;#8217;ll want verifiable SBOMs and not just SBOMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this talk about exactly again? &amp;#8220;A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>AI Law &amp; Ethics for sustainability corporate governance</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the era of AI, EU regulators struggle in definying a level playfield for the fruitful development of technology and utmost protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. The so-called AI Act is going to be approved by the end of 2023 and should come into force after a 2-year grace period. In any case most of the provision will be strongly risk-based and accountability oriented. In this fragmented and complex scenario, it is extremely interesting to observe how the use of AI law and AI ethics can serve the purposes of sustainability corporate governance, fostering innovation AND preserving fundamental rights and freedoms in a measurable and viable manner, having rights entering into business logics and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<abstract>The right to install any software on any device and various cases about the refund of pre-installed software</abstract>
				<subtitle>The right to install any software on any device and various cases about the refund of pre-installed software</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers try to force to use the preinstalled software on the PC you acquire, sometimes also claiming that alternative software will not work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2018 Luca purchases a Lenovo Tablet/PC and, since it comes with Microsoft Windows pre-installed, he requested the refund to Lenovo, but Lenovo denied to refund Luca. A court case was initiated, and Lenovo was condemned to pay a punitive damages of 20&amp;#8217;000 euros for its abusive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this &amp;#8220;historic&amp;#8221; case, some other refund were request to other companies, such as HP, Dell, Microsoft, Acer, and again to Lenovo. Each OEM tried to deny the refund, with various reasons such as contractual clauses contained in the sale contract or in the same license agreement, or the need to delete the Product Key stored in the MSDM BIOS ACPI table and therefore they require to send the PC to their laboratories. These reasons have no valid legal basis, because – at least in Italy – the license agreement is a contract totally unrelated to the sale contract, so a third party may not impose any action on your material good, and the license agreement has remained without causal and economic justification, because not accepted and missed to be concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>aka Bringing software right-to-repair to the masses</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Enforcing the General Public License (GPL) to bring real software freedom to people can be very challenging in practice, but many of the steps in the process are straight-forward. As the only organization enforcing the GPL for Linux, Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) receives a huge quantity of GPL violation reports, and needs to triage each one as the beginning of our process. The next step is called the &amp;#8220;CCS check&amp;#8221; (complete corresponding source check), a crucial but barely known activity that determines whether some candidate source code actually corresponds to the device/binaries that the candidate was provided for. We will discuss the CCS check in detail, providing examples and tips for doing your own checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we&amp;#8217;ll cover the offer check, something everyone can do to help in SFC&amp;#8217;s efforts to bring real software right-to-repair to every device running Linux. Whether you want to check offers for source code, review a CCS candidate, or go even further with additional GPL enforcement work of your own, this talk will set you up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>How Cyber Resilience Act is going to change FOSS forever and what can we do about it?</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;CRA at the time of submission is still in a draft status, but it is relatively clear that it will impose a duty to make the software safer if and when it is distributed on the market as a final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the safety requirements includes the obligation to collect and keep available for inspection a list of software components obtained from third parties, that is their provenance, and the insecurities obtained through mainly CVE scanning. Incidentally there is an obligation to support and provide security patches after the product is placed on the market (hint, open source rulez).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source Software is not exempted per se, the current discussion is where the final burden and responsibility of complying, if at all, lies. In any case, whatever the outcome of such discussion is, open source projects should strive to ease up CRA compliance for their downstream adopters, if they want to keep them. We will concentrate on how open source projects that aim at being considered in an industry supply chain (including that of software industry) should strive to make the supply chain&amp;#8217;s life easier, building on our experience with Eclipse Oniro and the toolchain and processes we have devised for it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous compliance is rooted into Linaro&amp;#8217;s everyday activities, whether the target is kernel development, a SOC Yocto SDK, an SDV, or consumer electronics project. Open source is at the center of today&amp;#8217;s software innovation, ubiquitous across products and services and, as such open source needs to evolve from a mere innovation into a production-grade engine. Linaro, one of the leading linux kernel contributors, is perfectly positioned to support our customers and the entire open source community throughout this transition. This talk will showcase Linaro&amp;#8217;s continuous compliance and production-grade processes, artifacts, and best practices and shed some light on what&amp;#8217;s happening under the hood of one of the world leading open source organizations and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) are rapidly becoming increasingly important in the software supply chain. Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) is a freely available ISO standard that defines the way of communicating information about software components. It includes, but is not limited to, metadata such as name and version, but also licensing and security information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present the latest updates from the ever-changing landscape of SBOMs and SPDX, focusing in real-world use cases. Familiarity with the concepts will not be assumed, as they will be briefly explained.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ZOOOM Framework: Legal aspects of FOSS and beyond</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;License compliance efforts for software projects involve not only legal-oriented actions, but also governance elements such as organizational processes and community management. The larger the community or the organization working collectively, the more complex a compliance program for software projects may become. Free Software licenses being direct licensing models are easier to comply with in comparison to proprietary licenses. This talk will give an overview of the Free Software licensing compliance practices, including initiatives such as REUSE for streamlining copyright and license information for software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ZOOOM Framework: Business Aspects of FOSS and Beyond</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Companies can engage in the 3Os in many ways and for different reasons. In many cases, strategic and competitive advantages are at the core of a company’s decisions, but in other cases, motivations can involve social and ethical considerations such as reciprocity, altruism, and democratization of knowledge. In this talk, we outline the main business-related motivations identified by the ZOOOM project for using and contributing to FOSS. Among them: pursuing competitive advantage, reduction of development costs, technological innovation, access to knowledge or assets, and interoperability. Based on the interviews conducted by the ZOOOM partners, we also discuss major challenges and risks that businesses leveraging the 3Os must navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ZOOOM Framework: An Ecosystemic Perspective</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we analyse the ecosystem trend in the context of the 3Os, particularly FOSS. Based on the existing literature and data from ZOOOM interviews, we explore the potential roles that companies can play in open-source ecosystems, their interactions with the other players of the ecosystem, and their awareness about the impact that systemic elements have on their business. Most companies recognize the advantages of being embedded in ecosystems where the creation of new knowledge is facilitated by joint research work, collaboration, and expertise sharing. However, companies identify themselves into specific roles depending on their strategy, main business, network structures, and communities. Finally, we outline a multilevel framework of how business and innovation ecosystems complement each other in the realm of the 3Os.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>How to keep free software projects happy and healthy</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Open source communities, when they have reached a certain size, face their very own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the virtual world, timezones, language barriers and dealing with many e-mails can become a burden. In the real world, the organization of travels to project meetings, the planning of annual conferences in an easy to reach location, and even the shipment of gadgets around the globe turn out to be quite demanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While free software projects might have the same diversity and outreach as large organizations, they often have not the same resources at hand as established corporations. They need to be a bit more creative &amp;#8211; but luckily, that&amp;#8217;s in their DNA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of sharing knowledge openly, this talk intends to give some real-life examples of challenges your community may face, unexpected situations you might run into and how to solve them &amp;#8211; sometimes in unconventional ways.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Transforming South Tyrol’s Economy: Empowering Tourism and Agriculture through Decentralized Applications (dApps)</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The implementation of decentralized applications (dApps) holds immense potential for transforming two of the key economic sectors of South Tyrol: tourism and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tourism industry, dApps can revolutionize the way services are offered and transactions are processed. By utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technology, dApps can enable transparent and secure processes for booking accommodations, tours, and activities. This ensures that tourists have direct access to reliable information-, while it eliminates the need for intermediaries, and reduces costs. Moreover, dApps can facilitate decentralized reviews and ratings, empowering visitors to make informed decisions based on authentic feedback from fellow travelers, i.e., fake reviews can be eliminated. This fosters trust and enhances the overall tourist experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the agriculture sector, dApps can address key challenges faced by farmers and consumers alike. For example by implementing blockchain-based supply chain solutions, dApps can ensure traceability and transparency in the production, processing, and distribution of agricultural products. This allows consumers to verify the origin and quality of the products they purchase, promoting trust and supporting local producers. Additionally, dApps can facilitate direct farmer-to-consumer interactions through decentralized marketplaces, eliminating unnecessary middlemen and enabling fair and efficient transactions. This empowers farmers by providing them with a direct and secure channel to sell their products while offering consumers access to fresh and locally sourced goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing decentralized applications, South Tyrol can unlock new opportunities for its tourism and agriculture sectors. These applications not only enhance efficiency and reduce costs but also increase customer trust, promote sustainability, and support the local economy. As a result, dApps have the potential to shape a thriving ecosystem that benefits both businesses and consumers in South Tyrol&amp;#8217;s key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;StatsCounter tell us that in May &amp;#8217;23 the market share for the smartphones is split in this way: Android/Google 67.56%, iOS/Apple 31.6%. Which means the remaining is less that 1%. Today we are speaking about that 1%: available alternatives, future outlook and most important why we have to care of about that 1%. Spoiler: because a study of the University of Edinburgh and the Trinity College Dublin published in Q4/2021 proves what all we know &amp;#8211; our smartphones leak our data constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Combatting E-Waste’s Environmental Harm With Free Software</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to discarded information and communications technology equipment such as laptops, smartphones, and large and small household appliances. In 2015, Achim Steiner of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) described &amp;#8220;an unprecedented tsunami of electronic waste rolling out over the world&amp;#8221;. In 2016, 44.7 million tonnes of e-waste were generated, equivalent to 4500 Eiffel Towers. In 2019, the World Economic Forum determined e-waste to be the fastest growing waste stream in the world. In 2022, the amount of e-waste hit 59.4 million tonnes, a 33% increase since 2016. Given the economic, and not the technical logic driving the digital economy, devices are rendered obsolete before their time and the pile of e-waste continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-waste is the source of significant environmental harm. Production, transportation, and end-of-life treatment accounts for 80+% of a device&amp;#8217;s carbon footprint over its operating life. Extracting rare earth metals consumes copious amounts of energy; moreover, mining is typically done in the Global South under miserable social conditions. The end-of-life treatment of e-waste means those same devices return to the Global South, resulting in toxic pollution entering the environment and harming workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most devices have chips which need software to keep them running. Thus, software plays a crucial role in preventing e-waste: software determines a hardware&amp;#8217;s minimum working requirements, and for how long a device remains safely in use. For most users, environmental harm driven by software has largely remained overlooked … let alone that we can already do something about it with Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will provide a brief overview of the environmental harm from e-waste driven by software, and I will link the inherent values that come with a Free Software license to sustainable software design. By enabling full user autonomy and removing artificial vendor dependencies, Free Software means electronic devices that are otherwise unsupported by manufacturers remain in use. Lightweight and up-to-date software, free from bloat and energy-consuming ads, allows aging, less-powerful hardware to keep running and stay out of the waste bin. Software freedom means hardware freedom, and that means we are able to combat the environmental harm caused by e-waste with Free Software today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<abstract>How to effectively engage with your user community</abstract>
				<subtitle>How to effectively engage with your user community</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s competitive market, it has become crucial to build a thriving community of developers and users around your product. Gone are the days when code alone could make a product successful; the human element now plays a pivotal role. This community becomes the face and representation of your project to the outside world. Having worked on our Open Source project for over 8 years, I have accumulated a wealth of proven strategies for attracting contributors, training newcomers, and expanding the user base. In my presentation, I will explain how to effectively engage with your user community in order to achieve the following objectives: collect feedback, share use cases, contribute to documentation, identify bugs and collaboratively develop code&lt;br /&gt;
Because improving your product goes beyond just writing code; it involves nurturing a strong community of people.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sustainability of Open Source Software and Potentials in Developing Countries</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Although developing countries hold a lot of potential in software development and research, the licensing cost of commercial software, platforms, and online services serve as a hindrance in their widespread adoption. Open source software can be a very useful and viable solution in this regard. On one hand it can fill up the need for less costly software alternatives. On the other hand, it can reduce the adoption of pirated versions of commercial software by individuals and groups to make up for the cost factor. Furthermore, with more adoption of open source software in the developing countries, it will also encourage and engage more programmers from the developing countries to maintain the open source software and to contribute to it, adding to the sustainability of various open source projects and thus benefiting open source software development beyond borders. The speaker, who has the experience of working in both the developing countries as well as here in Alto-Adige/Sud-Tirol region, will share insights on this topic from both of these diverse perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sharing the power of appreciation: Celebrating ‘I Love Free Software Day’</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of Free Software, expressing gratitude towards Free Software contributors often goes unnoticed. The &amp;#8220;I Love Free Software Day&amp;#8221; (https://ilovefs.org) provides a platform for individuals and organisations to do exactly this, showing appreciation. But it is crucial to recognize that our appreciation for Free Software should extend far beyond this single day. This talk highlights the significance of the &amp;#8220;I Love Free Software Day&amp;#8221; as a platform for expressing support, love, and gratitude towards the developers and contributors who make Free Software possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the presentation, we will showcase memorable moments and successful initiatives from past celebrations, demonstrating the collective efforts to acknowledge and honor the impact of Free Software. We will discuss ideas and strategies for making the upcoming &amp;#8220;I Love Free Software Day&amp;#8221; even more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is essential to emphasize that our expressions of love and support for Free Software should not be limited to just one day. While the &amp;#8220;I Love Free Software Day&amp;#8221; serves as a catalyst for celebration, it should inspire us to continue demonstrating our gratitude throughout the year. We will explore ways to incorporate ongoing appreciation into our daily lives, such as contributing to Free Software projects, advocating for their importance, and recognizing the efforts of developers and contributors regularly also in a financial way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending our appreciation beyond a single day, we can cultivate a culture of continuous support for Free Software. We invite everyone interested in Free Software to join us in this endeavor, as we strive to create an environment where gratitude and acknowledgment become integral parts of our interactions within the Free Software community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us embrace the &amp;#8220;I Love Free Software Day&amp;#8221; (https://ilovefs.org) as a starting point, a reminder of the significance of Free Software, and a call to action to express our love and support throughout the year. Together, we can build a community that values and appreciates the tireless efforts of Free Software developers and contributors, making a lasting impact on the future of software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Exploring the evolution of research topics during the COVID-19 pandemic</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped research across various fields, producing an unprecedented flood of articles. In response, several open-access corpora were created; among them, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) collected over a million articles in 2.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we introduce the CORD-19 Topic Visualizer (CORToViz), a method and tool for exploring CORD-19&amp;#8217;s scientific abstracts. It uses a stack of modern open source technologies to cluster articles and mine temporal topics. CORToViz has an interactive dashboard for quick topic visualization, time series tracking, and statistical testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show the results extracted with CORToViz, which allowed us to visualize and tell in a synthetic way what happened to react against COVID-19, comparing it with the key moments of the pandemic. The high adaptability of our approach suits any textual document corpus, and it lends itself easily to exploring new challenging fields of research, such as climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORToViz represents the first prototype of a series, which we aim to develop within the NGI Search Program, under the TETYS project (Topics Evolution That You See), aiming to build the next-generation Web topics explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Can AI counteract Health-related Fake News?</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>HeReFaNMi (Health-Related Fake News Mitigation): an open-source project to counteract health-related misinformation</abstract>
				<subtitle>HeReFaNMi (Health-Related Fake News Mitigation): an open-source project to counteract health-related misinformation</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;HeReFaNMi (Health-Related Fake News Mitigation) is an NGI-Search-funded project to give back trustworthiness to the Internet community by tackling fake news spread. Other than the well-known cyber threats, several factors have been undermining the Internet search experience lately. One of the pandemic&amp;#8217;s lessons learned concerns the health-related fake news spread over websites and social media networks. Some nefarious effects came as a non-negligible hesitancy towards national healthcare systems&amp;#8217; guidelines. Since then, several AI-powered solutions have been developed to counteract fake news circulation using supervised and unsupervised learning. The task is challenging due to the need for continuous updating upon introducing new scientific findings. The so-called data drift and catastrophic forgetting also affect the effectiveness of AI-powered classification methods.&lt;br /&gt;
LLMs (Large Language Models) have recently made their way through the AI landscape by delivering unprecedented performances over text analytics, mining, question and answering systems, and text generation. However, LLMs suffer from Hallucination, meaning they can elaborate contents that are unreliable as a source of truth even when fine-tuned on scientifically sound datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent open source libraries apply machine learning for forced alignment of speech and text and make it possible to produce text that is synchronized to audio in various languages. This makes it possible to produce a new type of reading experience: the videobook! This contribution talks about a pilot project that aims to produce videobooks based on hundreds of audiobooks and texts that are already in the public domain (such as librivox and the gutenberg project). Possible applications in the educational domain are discussed: such as language learning, accessibility and e-learning applications&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Can competitors work together with open source ?</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When community and Open source mindset are part of a company culture, it becomes easy to plan and project new products (even with potential competitors). In an open source project, all or part of the produced material is made publicly available for others to use, under certain conditions. The mistery of the &amp;#8220;unpaid programmer&amp;#8221; disappears when corporations see benefits coming from other members in the project and even fear of &amp;#8220;loosing control&amp;#8221; is balanced with continuous feedbacks from developers and users. This is the story of a new project&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>BIM2FEM: From Building Information Modeling to Finite Element Analysis</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>An open-source-based workflow</abstract>
				<subtitle>An open-source-based workflow</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The construction industry currently lacks automated open-source-based workflows for thermal and structural analysis of buildings. The Finite Element Method (FEM) represents the state-of-the-art approach for structural and thermal analysis in construction engineering. With the recent increase in computing power, complex models can now be analyzed within a feasible amount of time. However, the integration of FEM into Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows remains an active area of research. While some commercial software provides interfaces and plug-ins for BIM-integrated finite element analysis, their capabilities are limited and their use is restricted to the corresponding commercial software. Customizable open-source-based approaches exist, but they lack consistent and robust workflows. A consistent data flow of material properties and boundary conditions is essential but remains a challenging task that has not yet been sufficiently addressed. Fraunhofer Italia has developed a workflow based on the open IFC-standard and open-source FEM software packages, which has been tested and validated through the creation of a software prototype. This talk will introduce the developed workflow and demonstrate the prototype’s functionalities through selected use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Open Tracing Tools: Overview and Comparison</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Open Tracing Tools are software tools that enable the monitoring, debugging, and optimization of distributed software architectures. They provide a way to trace and understand the flow of requests and data through various components of a distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last months, the authors conducted a study to select and compare 30 tracing tools using a systematic literature review approach. They analysed the open source licence, features, architecture, the collected data, interoperability, but also the popularity, benefits, and issues of each tool, using topic modelling and sentiment analysis. The results offer a systematic comparison of the selected tracing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll say it in advance: there is one perfect tool that is better than all the others but this talk will present a) a brief overview of what open tracing tools are and the OpenTelemetry standard, b) the process followed in the study and c) the obtained results. For those that want to read the entire report, here it is: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06875.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;For open-source developers, user feedback provides a direct line between both parties, offering valuable insights. That&amp;#8217;s at least how the theory goes In reality, the feedback is often skewed, and the minority of negative loudmouths sometimes overshadows the silent majority of satisfied and grateful users. Needless to say, this doesn&amp;#8217;t do any favors to open-source developers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Predict security attacks in FOSS</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>Why you want it and how to do it</abstract>
				<subtitle>Why you want it and how to do it</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;FOSS is here to stay, displacing malevolent privative counterparts—great!&lt;br /&gt;
FOSS exposes bugs to be found and fixed by the community—great!&lt;br /&gt;
FOSS shows security issues than can be exploited by attackers—gr..what?&lt;br /&gt;
In the last decades, source code transparency has made the job of black-hat hackers increasingly easy. We now have security websites exposing vulnerabilities and even exploits online—and despite good practices like responsible disclosure, it is the sheer amount of (external) code what makes everyone ultimately vulnerable. In plain words, nobody&amp;#8217;s safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that base, this talk puts forward the need for a concept of *probability of future exploits*. This is crucial for project management, but also at developer level, to see the risks of not upgrading (or yes upgrading!) a dependency. We show how this probability can, and must, be computed from a project&amp;#8217;s dependency tree, in a manner that only the use of FOSS can allow. We also show that the development history of the project and its dependencies is key to getting useful results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we merge the dependency tree and development history of a project into a white-box model, which we use to estimate the probability of future exploits. We show how to do it for the Java-Maven environment, for which we can use the FOSS tool &amp;#8216;FIG&amp;#8217;. FIG, written in C++ and released under GPLv3, was designed for statistical estimations and can compute the probability of attacks in complex scenarios like the ones at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Let's stop feeding the surveillance economy</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The federated identity ecosystem is one of the key mechanisms by which the platform and surveillance economy has grown into today&amp;#8217;s shape, mostly on the shoulders of a vast number of Open Source contributions. Self Sovereign Identity is a privacy, freedom, control first approach to managing identity in a decentralised and secure way. In his talk, Georg Greve will provide a primer into SSI, how it works, and share insights from developing the SSI stack within the Eclipse Cross Federation Services Components, formerly Gaia-X Federation Services.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Technical leverage analysis in the Python ecosystem: lessons learned</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;[Context:] Technical leverage is the ratio between dependencies (other people&amp;#8217;s code) and own codes of a software package. It has been shown to be useful to characterize the Java ecosystem and there are also studies on the NPM ecosystem available. [Objective:] By using this metric we aim to analyze the Python ecosystem, how it evolves, and how secure it is, as a developer would perceive it when deciding to adopt or update (or not) a library. [Method:] We collect a dataset of the top 600 Python packages (corresponding to 21,205 versions) and used a number of innovative approaches for its analysis including the use of a two-part statistical model to deal with excess zeros, a mathematical closed formulation to estimate vulnerabilities that we confirm with bootstrapping on the actual dataset. [Results:] Small Python package versions have a median technical leverage of 6.9x their own code, while bigger package versions rely on dependencies code a tenth of their own (median leverage of 0.1). In terms of evolution, Python packages tend to have stable technical leverage through their evolution (once highly leveraged, always leveraged). On security, the chance of getting a safe package version when choosing a package is actually better than previous research has shown based on the ratio of safe package versions in the ecosystem. [Conclusions:] Python packages ship a lot of other people&amp;#8217;s code and tend to keep doing so. However, developers will have a good chance to choose a safe package version.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MBBS: A Multimodal Behavioral Biometric Scheme for Smartphone User Authentication</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we present MBBS, a tetra-model behavioral biometric-based authentication scheme designed specifically for smartphones. MBBS utilizes four distinct modalities to authenticate users: touchscreen swiping patterns, taps on &amp;#8220;text-independent&amp;#8221; 8-digit numbers, name writing on the touchscreen, and micro-movements of the hand during the entry process. To enhance overall accuracy and security, MBBS incorporates a state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) powered data augmentation architecture. This innovative approach allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of MBBS using both real user samples and augmented samples, consisting of a combination of &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;GAN-generated&amp;#8221; data, on an actual Android device. One of the key advantages of MBBS is its high usability, as it eliminates the need for users to remember any secret information. Instead, it leverages users&amp;#8217; familiarity with natural processes, thereby increasing accuracy in real-time by employing GAN technology, all without requiring a large sample size from users. We will also present preliminary results from our performance, security, and usability analysis, which showcase a positive opinion regarding the effectiveness of our developed authentication mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Recommending security fixes for weak open-source code with AI</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is a metaphor that describes not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs. The effort to refactor it increases if it remains for a long in the software. When developers are aware of it and admit it in source code comments, the debt is called Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Thus, SATD indicates weak code that developers are aware of. The question is whether they are aware that this code may be vulnerable to attacks. This presentation will illustrate how artificial intelligence can be employed to recommend security fixes for vulnerabilities to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>Improving the Internet as a platform, one Free Software at a time</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet today forms the backbone of the digitisation of our society and economy. As connectivity increases, the boundaries between the real and digital world get increasingly blurred. However, there has been an erosion of trust in the Internet following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of the proliferation and impacts of online disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done to improve the Internet as a platform for future generations? What initiatives are currently in place to build key technological blocks of an Internet that supports human-centric values, such as privacy, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and norms all citizens should enjoy in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore why the current state of the internet must be re-imagined and re-engineered in order to support healthy societies, the existing European Commission initiative to work towards doing so, and the role of Free Software in accomplishing these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Brand-New Version of IGis Maps</title>

				<abstract>The “swiss knife” developed and used in South Tyrol for the integrated management of Geo Referenced data and related information</abstract>
				<subtitle>The “swiss knife” developed and used in South Tyrol for the integrated management of Geo Referenced data and related information</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;2023 saw the launch, after a long and well-structured revision and development process, all based on a fruitful collaboration between several departments of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, most of the township in South Tyrol, Informatica Alto Adige (SIAG &amp;#8211; Technical partner) and the Consortium of Municipalities of the Province of Bolzano, of the new version of the integrated geographic data management system IGis Maps. In use for years in South Tyrol, has in the Consortium one of its most enthusiastic contributors and supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first version was released about eight years ago and its implementation was based on the idea of creating a multi-purpose GIS management system that could support different types of users, that was highly customizable, and, above all, that could be widely shared among the various management entities, both public and private, present within our territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of use and ad-hoc developments, we can finally present the new version of the IGis Maps system, which incorporates all the technical and technological improvements we realized the system needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not just a major update together with new functionalities combined inside the previous software structure, but a true re-engineering that led, among other things, to a new and more efficient user interface, a major advancement regarding the internal security, an optimization and improvement of the entire editing section as well as an optimization of the section regarding the automatic geo-processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mobile version is currently under development to better support any field activities, for which a very powerful option will be included, the possibility of creating special work sessions in off-line mode so as to be able to operate even in areas without a proper cellular line network coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other very important peculiarities concern that the system is developed using a totally free software code and infrastructure, that a detailed documentation has been produced to ensure sustainability to any further future evolution, even in case of technical partner turnover, and finally, that by taking advantage of the high standards and levels of security access can be guaranteed to any type of user. From professional users, through dedicated access and qualifications or, using the ordinary SPID, to the private citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show examples of how different types of users and stakeholders now permanently use the system for the management of a variety of tasks related to their activities, and how it was possible to customize IGis Maps to create visualization and data management contexts that best meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also present a related project concerning the updating and the correction of the new technical basal cartography, built upon the new Basic Core specification, achieved through the automatic conversion implemented by the SIAG team starting from the previous National Core cartography. With the new IGis Maps it was possible to create an advanced editing and management environment that allow both experienced and less advanced users to interact with this important new informative layer to fill all those gaps and errors that are more than normal to discover following an important automatic translation action such as the one carried out for the Basic Core project.&lt;/p&gt;

My main goal in any project in which I have participated has always been to use the data collected in the only (for me) useful and smart way. That is, draw practical and concrete information that would allow any \&quot;system\&quot; to be effectively managed and monitored. I dedicated myself to research and data collection activities in the field, development of relational databases, creation of decision support systems, software development and teaching\/training of many stakeholders who could then continue and effectively replicate the various management approaches implemented. Thus, making the projects self-sustainable. My education as a biologist also enabled me to translate the \&quot;scientific mindset\&quot; so that more technical\/managerial members, such as policymakers, for example, could concretely understand the results obtained and use them as a robust and solid basis for their final decisions. I have worked in many countries around the world, and this has allowed me to relate with so many different characters, but especially in regard to this I have realized my ability to work with the most diverse types of people and in the most diverse situations possible. I am curious beyond measure; for me, the most important thing is to understand the \&quot;working mechanism\&quot; of what I am dedicated to. Regardless of the topic or field. I am also sometimes a bit \&quot;lunatic\&quot;, but very logical. I like to work together with a wide range of professionality and personalities, and I consider myself a good communicator. Furthermore, I am passionate about so many things, for sure too many, engineering, mechanics, computer science, photography, new technologies in general, but above all there is in me an absolute love for the nature that surrounds us. A source of calm as well as deep inspiration.&quot;">Edoardo Scepi</person>

This initiative has become a great success: Our demand &amp;#8220;Public Money? Public Code!&amp;#8221; has found its way into government strategy papers, party programs, as well as coalition treaties, and is being discussed in public administrations across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we see less progress than expected and vendor lock ins remain a crucial issue. Digital sovereignty is redefined bypassing Free Software. There is openwashing in publicly funded companies, and government projects in favour of Free Software remain empty words. Public statistics on the procurement of Free Software are largely unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no longer enough to promote the idea of &amp;#8220;Public Money? Public Code!&amp;#8221;. We as the Free Software community should be even more vigilant than before – continuing to praise small steps in the right direction, but pointing out and criticising omissions and lack of implementation. We should become more like watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk we will look at some examples of lack of implementation of Free Software policies. We will discuss how we, as civil society, can identify such shortcomings and how to deal with them. We will present our initiative TEDective – a free-software solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts, aiming to provide you with a powerful tool to keep an eye on real progress towards &amp;#8220;Public Money? Public Code!&amp;#8221; across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>GovStack project a univeral E-Government</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;GovStack aims to break down the barriers to building sustainable digital infrastructure and help governments create human-centered digital services that empower individuals and improve well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development to achieve a better world by 2030. Many of these goals rely on governments’ ability to deliver services to people. We know that digital technology can facilitate broader access and build more inclusive and resilient societies. Plus, digital government services can foster economic growth and promote trust in government institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GovStack is helping governments simplify the digital transformation process and reduce the cost, time, and resources required to create digital platforms and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is based on the SDG Digital Investment Framework, to help countries make smarter and more strategic decisions in their ICT investments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;AICS is the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation that started operating in 2016 with the ambition of aligning Italy with the main European and international partners in the commitment to development. KNOWAGE Labs are developing for AICS a platform that is probably unique in the world and will allow both the Agency and the public to access all the major indicators on the UN Sustainable Development Goals provided by international sources (World Bank, WTO, ILO..) and easily compare them. The solution will allow analysis to start from 3 different touch points: the infographic of SDG goals, the advanced search criteria, and the virtual assistant. Then, a customized dashboard will be provided to the user, allowing to further expand the analysis by interacting with charts, maps, tables, etc. This talk will show the state of art of the solution, highlighting objectives and expected results of the project, but also the new developments of KNOWAGE related to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>European regulators cast their eyes on maturing OSS communities</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As open source software becomes the foundation to build digital products, to run the backbones of ICT infrastructure and to ensure digital sovereignty and cyber resilience, both the technology as well as the communities that develop it inevitably move into the focus of regulators. The European Union is advancing a number of policy initiatives that regulate liability, cyber security, data handling and AI applications in digital products, among others. This is a challenge for the still quite decentralised and globally operating open source community. How could the open source community participate in legislative processes, and what may be the potential impacts of the upcoming regulation on the open source development process and community dynamics?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How can Blockchain technologies incorporate AI solutions for a safer and efficient Open Data ecosystem.</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 has fueled the need for a secure and decentralized cloud storage solution for digital assets. Web 2.0 was characterized by centralized platforms where user data was under the control of companies. In contrast, Web 3.0 aims to empower individuals and foster a decentralized web that supports and benefits the Free Software and Open Data Communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technologies facilitate seamless collaboration and interoperability among diverse stakeholders in the Free Software and Open Data communities. Developers can establish open and transparent ecosystems where data can be shared, verified, and integrated across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beez, with its own blockchain infrastructure, offers a secure and transparent platform for digital asset exchanges, bolstering transaction integrity and trust. By distributing data across a network of nodes, Beez ensures security and mitigates the risk of single points of failure. Users retain control over their data, safeguard their privacy, and can take advantage of the incentive mechanisms offered by blockchain networks.&lt;br /&gt;
During our presentation, we will explore the role of AI within Beez&amp;#8217;s ecosystem, facilitating accelerated data processing, correlation, and intelligent automation. AI unlocks valuable insights from blockchain data, and we will touch upon the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to enhance programming performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of Blockchain and AI technologies holds great potential for advancing the safety and efficiency of the Open Data ecosystem. By combining decentralized data storage, trust-building mechanisms, and intelligent data processing, Beez is paving the way for a more secure, transparent, and user-centric digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Real-time aeroplane tracking and the Open Data Hub</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>Using the Open Data Hub as real-time data backbone</abstract>
				<subtitle>Using the Open Data Hub as real-time data backbone</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Tracking aeroplanes in real time with Open Source Software is possible. Aircrafts must continuously send their current flight parameters to air traffic controllers on the ground and to other aircrafts. This generates a lot of data, especially when planes are being tracked by multiple sensors.&lt;br /&gt;
The Open Data Hub on the other hand offers a great backbone for data storing and processing, where the correct datasets have to be identified and filtered. After all transformation on the data is done, it will be exposed via API to be further used by a web application.&lt;br /&gt;
Bringing together sensor generated data, the Open Data Hub and custom web applications, is a showcase on how the Open Data Hub can be used as a service: OaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

				<abstract>how we will gather and monitor multi-source spatially-interpolated meteorological parameters in near-real time</abstract>
				<subtitle>how we will gather and monitor multi-source spatially-interpolated meteorological parameters in near-real time</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Up-to date measurements of surface meteorological variables are essential to monitor weather conditions, their spatio-temporal variability and the potential effects on a wide range of sectors and applications. Moreover, when included in continuous records of long historical observations spanning several decades, they become essential for assessing long-term climate variability and change locally and on a regional level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated pipelines capable of retrieving and processing near-real time meteorological data satisfy the primary prerequisites towards the development and advancement of effective and operational climate services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a public and operational near real-time monitoring web platform in mind, we present automated pipelines to collect and process up-to-date daily temperature and precipitation records for Trentino South Tyrol (Italy) and surrounding areas, and to derive their spatially interpolated fields at sub-km scale. Our pipelines are composed by multiple steps including data download, sanity checks, reconstruction of missing daily records, integration into the historical archive, spatial interpolation and publication onto online FAIR catalogues as (openEO) “datacubes”. The different APIs, data formats and structure across the various data sources, and the need to merge the data onto harmonized meteorological layers, make this a typical case of the so-called Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) pipelines, and, in order to follow the principles of data reproducibility and Open Science, we embraced open-source automated workflow management through GitLab’s Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI/CD workflows greatly help the management of the relatively complex graphs of tasks required for our climate application, ensuring seamless orchestration with thorough flow monitoring, application logs, transactions rollbacks, and exception handling in general. Native pipeline-oriented software development also fosters a clean separation of roles among the tasks, and a more modular architecture. This effectively reduces barriers to collaborative development and paves the way for robust operational climate services for researchers and decision makers in the face of the changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free Software and Open Science</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Science movement aims to increase the transparency, reproducibility and inclusiveness of academic research. One of its central goals is therefore to make research outputs broadly available, e.g., manuscripts (Open Access) or research data (Open Data). While software/code created in the course of scientific research is a key artifact of scientific research that is clear distinct from the latter two, it has until recently not received the same attention as manuscripts or data, although it follows its own set of paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present an overview on how the core concepts of Free Software and the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reuseable) Principles intersect, what this means for managing code as research output and recent initiatives on the European level that will provide support for these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MLOps with Kubernetes: unleash the power of the ecosystem!</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a popular open-source software, today&amp;#8217;s de-facto open standard, to run production workloads. Innovation in the ecosystem thrives with multiple projects that enrich the platform&amp;#8217;s core. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is part of the same effort to bring automation into Kubernetes for ML pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session aims to explore the Kubernetes-native tools available such as Tekton, Argo CD, Kubeflow, and OpenDataHub, to apply DevOps and GitOps principles in AI/ML contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the session, attendees will have a clear understanding on how to automate and simplify the iterative process of integrating ML models into software development processes, production rollout, monitoring, retraining, and redeployment for continued prediction accuracy with open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;

				<subtitle>DOI and citation improvements in metadata of EDP-portal</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;EDP-portal is the access point to the Environmental Data Platform of Eurac Research since 2021 to achieve FAIRness of our datasets. It allows to publish data and metadata and provides APIs and web services for data access. In the last 2 years the EDP improved the findability and accessibility of the data collected throughout the curation of metadata that was improved with the DOI registration for datasets. The result is a higher metadata quality where the final user can easily find how to properly cite datasets with a persistent identifier. The portal itself and main data repositories are registered in FAIR-sharing portal with their own DOI. The SW components of the EDP are totally based on open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SMODEX – a Python package for understanding the evolution of soil moisture anomalies</title>
				<language/>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The complexity of agricultural droughts requires a consistent, reliable, and systematic method for monitoring and reporting. Amongst the various indices used to monitor this phenomenon, the soil moisture anomaly has been proven to be a more reliable predictor. However, the datasets required for computing this index are often large and computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we have developed SMODEX, a Python package that enables scalable, fast, and open-source standard-compliant computation and visualization of soil moisture anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMODEX simplifies the computation and visualization of time-series for soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies from high-dimensional climate datasets. It allows for quick and easy parallelization of the computation on a daily, weekly, and monthly timescale. Additionally, SMODEX implements a straightforward workflow for automating the use of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in producing and sharing outputs by leveraging the open source STAC API. The package is extendible and provides information on how to contribute to the project, test suites, test coverage, and a use case for the South Tyrol region, all provided in the package repository. In the future, additional agricultural drought indices and indicators would be included to serve to even larger community of researchers, policy makers, and individual users.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why open digital infrastructure matters</title>
				<language/>
				<abstract>hardware &amp; software infrastructure for Europe</abstract>
				<subtitle>hardware &amp; software infrastructure for Europe</subtitle>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Software freedom can be defined in many ways but in legal terms it is squarely defined by a set of approved FSF and OSI software licenses. Yet everyone realizes that beyond these licenses the goal of software freedom and digital sovereignty cannot be achieved without the ability to master and create hardware components and systems &amp;#8211; and beyond that, to rely on open digital infrastructure (servers, datacenters, and resources) . This talk will present the challenges around these topics and what we, collectively in Europe already do and can do to ensure our independence and our freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;MOSH and MOAH are the abbreviation of two groups of chemical compounds found in mineral oils. “MOSH” stands for Mineral Oil Saturated Hydrocarbons. MOAH stands for Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Both of them are under European deeply evaluation because there are two food contaminants. According to the current state of scientific knowledge, there is no sufficient toxicological evidence to prove a health risk to humans from saturated mineral oil fractions (MOSH). Meanwhile, MOAH are suspected to be carcinogenic (especially PAH-like compounds with 3-7 ring systems), therefore their levels in food should be reduced according to the ALARA-principle (as low as reasonably achievable).

She has an extensive background in events coordination &amp;amp; planning, agency management, and campaign development having worked for international brands in the cultural and outdoor sector.\r\n\r\nShe is currently collaborating with the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) as the Deputy Coordinator Italy, focusing on strenghtening the existing Italian free software community and fostering its growth.\r\n\r\nMarta\u2019s core competencies are based on combining people centric, innovative and a human centred approaches within an environment of radical collaboration. She is currently furthering her studies in this field of Design Thinking at Hasso-Plattner-Institut in Berlin.\r\n\r\nShe values free software due the integration of ideas of critical consumption, minimalism and sustainability. She believes that the choices we make in the fundamental issues of freedom in software are fundamental issues in our lives and in the way we are shaping the future of our society.\r\n\r\nHer outgoing personality and the experience developed in forging relationships in her previous roles underpins her approach as Community Manager.\r\n\r\nDue to her strong interests in sustainability and ecology, Marta is especially interested in the interplay of Free Software with other fields such as ecology and one of her future goals would be to conduct a research project about the impact of digital technologies on the physical environment and its contribution to the so called Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle drops make the mighty ocean\u201d (sono le gocce che fanno il mare) is her motto.&quot;">Marta Andreoli</person>
